World Cup Jelly SDK
Agent-first TypeScript SDK for FIFA World Cup data, structured football context, and prediction-market decision support.

World Cup Jelly SDK is a standalone toolkit for AI agents and quantitative workflows that need reliable, normalized World Cup intelligence. It combines football data ingestion, event normalization, match context building, and market-mapping utilities so an agent can reason better about World Cup-related questions on prediction platforms such as Polymarket and Kalshi.

Goals
Provide a single normalized interface for World Cup data.
Help agents answer football-event questions with structured context instead of raw text.
Map football data into prediction-market objects and features.
Support historical analysis, pre-match forecasting, and live-event monitoring.
Stay narrow: FIFA World Cup and adjacent national-team tournament intelligence only.
Non-goals
Not a general sports SDK.
Not a full betting or execution engine.
Not an unofficial trading bot by default.
Not a replacement for licensed official FIFA feeds where rights are restricted.
Quick Start
import { WorldCupJellySDK } from "world-cup-jelly-sdk";
const sdk = new WorldCupJellySDK({
  providers: {
    footballApi: { apiKey: process.env.FOOTBALL_API_KEY },
    polymarket: { enabled: true },
    kalshi: { enabled: true }
  }
});
const context = await sdk.agents.getPredictionContext({
  question: "Will Brazil win Group G?",
  platform: "POLYMARKET"
});
console.log(context);

Top-level namespaces
sdk.fifa — fixtures, standings, teams, squads, bracket, history
sdk.intelligence — form, matchup analysis, narratives, tiebreaks
sdk.prediction — feature building, market-question parsing, confidence scoring
sdk.markets — Polymarket and Kalshi read-only integration
sdk.agents — Claude/Jelly-compatible tool response formatting
sdk.backtesting — historical World Cup scenario analysis
Installation
npm install world-cup-jelly-sdk

Compliance
Respect provider licensing and redistribution limits.
Keep FIFA branding and official-data assumptions conservative.
Separate "facts from providers" from "model-generated predictions."
Do not present model output as certainty.
Keep market reading separate from automated execution by default.
